                <p>It was a great experience studying , a memory to cherish for lifetime. My experience at Sharda was full of learning and grooming. Being a global university It gave me an opportunity to meet different kind of people from around the world and learnt many things from them. I am thankful to all the faculties, mentors and entire SET department for providing us with quality education. I am also grateful to TNP Cell for organising placements in this pandemic and helping me to get placed in 3 companies on Campus including Tcs Digital.   Overall it was a great experience and lifetime memory at Sharda University. If you want to make a career in CSE I would highly recommend you to join  Campus</p>

                <p>I definitely would recommend LWTech and would encourage students to study hard and inform themselves as much as possible about the several academic opportunities the Institution offers.
